`conversational design` `chatbot`

**Overview**: Due to most of my work being internal, I can't show a lot of the work on my site. At IBM under CIO design I worked with multiple teams to improve internal products. Below is a summary for one project I worked on involving IT Support for employees across IBM.

**Role**: Lead UX Designer and Researcher

**Project**: IT Support Chatbot

- Designed an automated response tool in Slack that answered commonly asked IT questions.
- Designed the conversational flow. 
- Succesfully helped employees find solutions to their problems and spend less time searching for information. Also filled a gap when a co-worker or support is not online like at night time.
- Reduce number of tickets for simple IT problem. Success was measured through data and user research.
- Created a standard for chatbot on Slack in Figma.
