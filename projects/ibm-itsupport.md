Note: Due to most of my work being internal, I can't show a lot of the work on my site. As part of IBM's CIO Design team, I work with multiple teams to improve our internal products. From legacy tools to new initiatives, I have guided design workshops and conducted user research making internal products more effective and user-friendly.
