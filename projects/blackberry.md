#### BlackBerry: UX Research

For my main project at BlackBerry I was tasked to find the best camera experience on the market. It was a very broad topic so I talked to the Camera Team at BlackBerry to narrow my search. This helped me establish the camera markets and the Camera Teamâ€™s technical benchmarks. The camera nerd in me was thrilled because I was shown all the nifty equipment to test the cameras (all custom made!).


#### Designing the Study

Each participant would test out three competitor phones and go through a series of fun tasks. I have illustrated the tasks in figure 1. Each task depicted tried to capture different aspects of the user's camera experience. For example, the sharing task assesses the ease of sharing photos.

#### Analysing and Presenting Insights
I have learned how important it is to communicate your findings in a compelling way to different teams (designers and engineers). You need to be able to [visualize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-oiKt7bUU8) the data so that it is easy to parse through and not drown the audience in numbers.
