`surveys` `user interviews` `enterprise design`

**Overview**: I worked on moving internal employees over to a new mail client.

**Role**: UX Designer and Researcher with one other designer

**Impact Overview**:
- Email is an essential tool for employees. The old client was slow and no longer conformed to modern UX standards (it was Lotus Notes).
- Survey a sample of IBM population on what their preference of mail migration was
- Launched the pilot of a multi-year project to **migrate all 500,000+ IBM employee** from one mail client to another
- Established the series of emails, tutorials, and before and after migration experience when employees set up their computer and phones for the first time
- Incrementally **improved user experience** with rounds of interviews and long term metric gathering
- Journey mapped the entire experience for the user to connect teams and ensure there was no gaps during an employee migration.


Note: Due to most of my work being internal, I can't show a lot of the work on my site. As part of IBM's CIO Design team, I work with multiple teams to improve our internal products. From legacy tools to new initiatives, I have guided design workshops and conducted user research making internal products more effective and user-friendly.
