`surveys` `user interviews` `enterprise design`

**Overview**: Due to most of my work being internal, I can't show a lot of the work on my site. At IBM under CIO design I worked with multiple teams to improve internal products. Below is a summary for one project I worked on moving internal employees over to a new mail client.  

**Role**: UX Designer and Researcher with one other designer

**Project**: Enterprise Mail Migration

-  Survey a sample of IBM population on what their preference of mail migration was 
- Launched the pilot of a multi-year project to migrate all 500,000+ IBM employee from one mail client to another
- Established the series of emails, tutorials, and before and after migration experience when employees set up their computer and phones for the first time
- Incrementally improved user experience with rounds of interviews and long term metric gathering
- Journey mapped the entire experience for the user to connect teams and ensure there was no gaps during an employee migration.
