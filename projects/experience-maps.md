Some experience maps I've designed. Usually this was done over a couple of days with back and forth edits from the stakeholder. I realize most of the time people don't really know what they want until they see something first to edit. A good excercise in understanding what someone wants when they ask for it to "pop". A big pet peeve in the community. But unforunatly not everyone really knows the design process.
