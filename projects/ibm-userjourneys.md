**What did I do?**: I worked on creating a standardized way to evaluate user journeys for all IBM.com products.

**Role**: UX Designer. Collaborated with product team. Consulted with senior designers.

**Impact Overview**: Designing a system to evaluate IBM products
- My team was tasked with creating a consistent and great experience for users on IBM.com across 40 million pages owned by various teams across the world
- During the project I collaborated with multiple design teams to create a **standardized way show the user experience health** of IBM digital products to product teams
- For the pilot, I worked with the Blockchain product team and was able to **reduce the fragmentation** between their digital spaces â€“ website, in-product, and  emails. This evaluation allowed the team to think of the entire product journey and resulted in an **increase page views and engagement**.
- The program that we started is now a formalized set of tools and process any designer at IBM can access

Note: Due to most of my work being internal, I can't show a lot of the work on my site. As part of IBM's CIO Design team, I work with multiple teams to improve our internal products. From legacy tools to new initiatives, I have guided design workshops and conducted user research making internal products more effective and user-friendly.
