**Overview**: Due to most of my work being internal, I can't show a lot of the work on my site. At IBM under CIO design I worked with multiple teams to improve internal products. Below is a summary for one project I worked on moving internal employees over to a new mail client.  

**Role**: UX Designer. Collaborated with product team. Consulted with senior designers.

**Project**: Designing a system to evaluate IBM products

- My team was tasked with creating a consistent and great experience for users on IBM.com across 40 million pages owned by various teams across the world
- During the project I collaborated with multiple design teams to create a standardized way show the user experience health of IBM digital products to product teams
- For the pilot, I worked with the Blockchain product team and was able to reduce the fragmentation between their digital spaces â€“ website, in-product, and  emails. This evaluation allowed the team to think of the entire product journey and resulted in an increase page views and engagement.
- The program that we started is now a formalized set of tools and process any designer at IBM can access
