##### Research Phase
Nada told me there were many US college sport recruiting apps but there were not many for international students.

For this I looked at several sports recruiting apps (NCSA, BeRecruited, RecruitU, Lemonaid, JumpForward)

- List pros and cons of each one with screen shots


##### Prototyping Phase

I took over the UX design part of this app, around the prototyping phase. I started with the last designers
wireframe in illustrator. The designer was using InVision to show the interaction.

I was unsatisfied with how limited the interaction were in the InVision so I searched around for some prototyping tools. Atomic.io stood out because it was able to convey transitions, so I recreated the wireframes that I had in illustrator in atomic to learn the tool.
In the process I took out elements that was not user friendly (buttons too close, screen flows that didn't make sense etc).

I saw several things I knew that was needed to build the foundation of the wireframes before the hi-fidelity prototyping.
- Content: This app was all about sports statistics and would have many typeforms for users to fill out. Not only that each sport has it's own statistics, therefore the wireframe would need to actually have the correct content mapped out before designing.
- Form filling Usability: related to the first point, because of the extensive amount of data a user had to provide, how the forms were done was crucial to the user experience

- I asked Nada to map the information architecture of the app and made sure it would make sense to the user how to navigate there

#How to show data
In the app, there will be two sections that display a large amount of data. I would need to figure out a way to showw it in a readable way that is displayed on a small mobile screen. One view has a
comparison of stats from two coaches, while the other displays all the stats from an athlete/coach. The latter will be easy since it's just a data dump, the hard one would be how to let users
easily compare numbers. There is the option to force horziontal view on the user so that we have more room to display the numbers, the second choice is to figure out a layout tha twould work.
For now, I know I want to show it side by side, it looks odd since it's not exactly centered to the top photo, so I will need to play around with that a bit.

I also need to insure that the font size is readable.

Another thing I had to account for is the list length variability, there is content that is quite long which makes option 1 and 2 have the potential to overlap
Playing around more with porportions it already seems that it would become an unreadable mess

Horizontal space is the one lacking not vertical space. Although too long of a list is detrimental, I will have to figure out a way to chunk the lists better.

##### Experimenting with list views

There were a couple of options for list views, expermiting with a bunch of layouts, the main thing I want the list to be is readable since it's such a large list of items, scannability for the user on the mobile is important.
One option has alot of white space, the other is optimized for quick scan but looks bad, and the last one is looks more consistent but I suspect there's more scanning since the items are too far apart.


##### The Search Page
- In the filter area, I decided I wanted a slider for all number ranges since would be the easiest way to fill it out,
- I wanted this page to be a quick browse of all the coaches/athlete so I made them into tiny profile cards, two horizontally. This might be problematic in the future because there's no way to discern why a coach would favourite a player with only their profile picture and the city and country they are in. This will likely need to be rethought. The althernatives are single profile view with more information, or a list view with information spread out horizontally.

- I came up with a couple of views for this search page, depending on what we want the user to do, how much information of the coaches and the athletics did we want to surface in the quick view profile, did we want enough information for users to quickly favourite? If not, how much information did we want for users to message a candidate.

- Version 1: Card style, more emphasized on user's profile pictures

- Version 2: List view, you can see more users at once with this view
- Version 3: List view expanded, this has more information so that user's can determine on candidates stats

- The mini profiles font is also a little to small, need to fix the legibility aspect.

## Comparing Coaches
- Following iOS design principal, I used a selection mode
- I liked how the Apple website did the guideded selection for comparing apple products, so I used that, I have not seen it on mobile, but I thought it would help users understand that you were limited to two coaches to compare.
- The notifications tab most likley will have to go elsewhere since it doesn't make much sense to be in the dashboard with with the Athlete/Coach list.


##### Picking the colour Pallate

I just asked Nada to use a colour generator to pick out colours that she liked.
