UI/UX Design for MassMotion for future version release. [Oasys Software: MassMotion](https://www.oasys-software.com/products/pedestrian-simulation/massmotion/).

Part of my time working at Arup was spent updating the existing user interface (fig.1) so that it felt less cluttered and looked cleaner. I made the software darker than its predecessor so that the geometric colours would be the focus. Blue accents were added to draw the eyes to important elements that could be toggled (fig.2).

MassMotion originally was just a plugin for Softimage. Currently, it is a stand alone software that analyzes pedestrian movements. A concrete example is a fire engineer modeling the time it takes for people exist a building ([video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVfQdjpXa4k&feature=youtu.be&list=UUCSaCU47M1miJaf7l357VTw), albeit a very dramatic one). The next transition for MassMotion was to have its own geometric generator. Therefore, my main job was to translate the tools and features in Softimage into MassMotion (fig.3).

Figure 4 is a mockup of the translated tools. This was designed so that information can be read easily. The design also took into consideration that these tools will be used through keyboard shortcuts. The initial learning curve would be steep; however, with repetition, the shortcuts would become procedural memory. This insight came from observing and interviewing users.

The original analysis input forms in Softimage (fig.5) were very hard to read. To redesign them, I used secondary research to try optimize the time to fill in information and to visually organize the inputs so that it can be quickly processed. One example of visual organization for quick processing is [label placement](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php).

Another project I was given was to create a new feature! This is a mockup of what could be in a new release. The mockup depicts a timeline (fig.6) that holds multiple ‘runs’. One of the biggest challenges that I ran into was trying to represent a physical object, an action, and a scene in one space. I drew solution inspirations from video editors, bus schedules, and Edward Tufte.

The most important thing that I learned from Arup was how to design abstract ideas for users. Specifically, abstract ideas that I know the inner workings to. For example, the thermostat. In all likelihood, the general population does not fully understand how a thermostat operates. If the user feels cold, then they might think that turning up the heat to the highest setting would warm up the house faster. However, that’s not how a thermostat really works. But the user doesn’t technically need to understand that, the design should be communicated in a way that the users input matches the desired output.
