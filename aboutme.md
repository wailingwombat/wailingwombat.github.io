### About Me

![profile](/images/profilepic.jpg)

So you want to know more about me eh? Well that's the first clue. I grew up in Vancouverl Canada, I've lived in all the major city in Canada as a child. I've lived in Calguary, Toronto, and Montreal. I now call New York City my home. In my spare time I like to take photos (link), collect too many plants (link), and cook (link). You can see my beef pho recipe here (link)!

I've always been interested in many things, which is probally why I picked such a mult displicnary academic focus like Cognitive Science. It was the perfect blend of everything I was interested in, psychology, computer science, anjdaodjsad, haidsad, ahdisaopd. My Univerisy days was where I pick up all my research skills from. I was obsessed with quanitifying the human mind. I didn't choose to go into the acadamia further though, because I was much to pragamatic and need to pay rent. Plus my interest was too varied to do intense focus on one niche project for a PHD.

As for design, it's just been something I've always been doing. Espeically digital design, you can see some of first drawings here in MS paint in my childhood (don't laugh). I also discovered the world of HTML and CSS, which I am sure many people my age are nostaligc about, designing home pages in Neopets. I joined yearbook and the newspaper club everywhere year and worked on print design and photography. While during my co-op I tried to find every user experience or user reearch experience job.
