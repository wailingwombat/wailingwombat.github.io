## As a designer I believe in making intuitive and accesible designs. Iâ€™m a storyteller first weaving in the needs of the user and business. **My specialty is bringing different teams to work together.**

I grew up in Vancouver, Montreal, and Toronto and currently based in NYC. My path into design began like many others on Neopets! This was where started to learn to design and code from creating shop fronts for others.

Drawing from my background in cognitve and computer sciences, I bring a research-driven perspective into my projects and can easily communicate and collaborate with developers and stakeholders across teams. I am always curious about why people make the decisions they do, and I find it exciting to design functional, accessible solutions that is **scaled for a large number of people, externally and also internally.**

When I am not designing you may find me taking street photos, making crooked pots, or finding the next plant to add to my home.

I also watch a lot of movies and tv and have a collection of [UI stills](https://www.are.na/anna-nguyen-0rkqu6uzk-q/user-interfaces-in-film-and-tv]).
