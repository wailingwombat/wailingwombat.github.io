So you want to know more about me eh? Well that's the first clue. I grew up in Vancouverl Canada, I've lived in all the major city in Canada as a child. I've lived in Calguary, Toronto, and Montreal. I now call New York City my home. In my spare time I like to take photos (link), collect too many plants (link), and cook (link). You can see my beef pho recipe here (link)!

I've always been interested in many things, which is probally why I picked such a mult displicnary academic focus like Cognitive Science. It was the perfect blend of everything I was interested in, psychology, computer science, anjdaodjsad, haidsad, ahdisaopd.
